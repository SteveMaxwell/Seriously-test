One Word	
I was eating lunch with a dad recently. He said, "Someone can call me any thing they want to call me, except one word â€“ lazy." He considered that the worst thing anyone could be called. Considering he was retired, that was pretty incredible. 

Doesn't it seem like we are living when being lazy or a "couch potato" is considered cool?
